# php-project-lvl1

## About
This project helps me learn php and gain experience in developing web applications! ;) 

The application is a game!
The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user. 
And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

You need use Composer, you can install brain-even system-wide with the following command:
